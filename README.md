# GSoC
This repository contains all documents related to my Google Summer of Code with Chromium. As a GSoC Intern for Chromium I worked on the Issues Tab on Chrome DevTools. Main part of work on Chrome Devtools involved developing a hiding mechanism for Issues in the Issues tab. I also worked on perforamce optimisations for rendering issues.
