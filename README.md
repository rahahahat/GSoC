# GSoC
This repository contains all documents related to my participation in Google Summer of Code with Chromium. As a GSoC Intern for Chromium I worked on the Issues Tab on Chrome DevTools. Main part of work on Chrome Devtools involved developing a hiding mechanism for Issues in the Issues tab. I also worked on perforamce optimisations for rendering Issues.

My code contributions and relevant project details can found on the [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p3ucb6cjuIa72aMQLnuJHvniX1j4lNewvy28C39oAdo/edit?usp=sharing)

The feature is showcased in the **Chrome 95 - What's New in DevTools** [video](https://youtu.be/T_Ppg7ghrWM?t=57) on the Google Chrome Developers Youtube Channel.
